Our task was to bypass traders and connect directly with producers. In our field, producers are ship owners who operate as factories for fishing, production, freezing of fish, and fish products. Considering that Serbia, compared to global giants, is not a strategic country in the fish business, the name Principal Duo is highly recognizable. The image built over the years ensures that information about quota allocation for fishing, fish catch, and global sales trends comes to us firsthand, directly from the source without intermediaries."
